Richard Scott's second series of early morning compositions; things he makes while waking up. A very similar setting to the first volume, but with very different results. Please dive in once again be amazed by Scott's sonic explorations. 

As with the first series the edits are kept to a bare minimum, so you really get a sense of the immediate interplay between ideas and the creation proces.
