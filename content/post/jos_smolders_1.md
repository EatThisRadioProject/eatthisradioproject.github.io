We are delighted to present you a mix by Jos Smolders. Jos Smolders is one of the founding fathers of the experimental electronic music scene in the Netherlands. He has had a huge impact in the Netherlands, and far beyond that. Beside his work as a musician he is well known for his excellent mastering skills at his EarLabs Studio. By all means a legend! 
For Eat This Radio he took 7 sketches from his studio work and put them in one big, one hour mix!
