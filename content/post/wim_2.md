Wim returns with a second mix. The description Wim gave us says all. Enjoy!
"Ok, i like long songs. i recently noticed that quite a few 15+ minutes songs were on my list of tracks that i've been spinning a lot. so, there was the idea: 15 songs that normally take over 15 minutes, cut down to about 4 minutes each. 
i know, it doesn't make sense: the whole point of most of these tracks is that they last a lot longer than 4 minutes, evolve slowly and have a distinct effect because of their length. but hey, i did it anyway. playing all these songs from the first note to the last would take almost 6 hours. 'radio edits' were invented for situations like this. 
i can recommend the full listen of course. in case you wondered: some of these are the opening sequence, others from the middle, some lean more towards the end."
