For this very special edition Richard Scott kindly provided us with a series of early morning compositions. Basically these are free works he makes while waking up. However, don't be fooled by the setting or the 'fleetingness' of these recordings; they are way more sophisticated than mere 'doodles'. Nevertheless Richards recordings here never loosing their playfulness. There is some free exploration of the instruments he works with but Richard never looses his sense of composition and aesthetic quality in this 1.5 hour collection.


Richard on these recordings:

*“I normally spend months/years considering, composing, editing, and mixing my solo compositions, so this was like going on holiday: no second takes, no material rejected, no subsequent editing or mixing, it is as completely raw as if it came from the instrument.”*
