This mix consists of songs Bastiaan has been listening to lately. Some of them are old and newly discovered, some of them are new discoveries. The end result is a moddy mix to enjoy at the start of autumn when darkness starts setting in earlier. Enjoy!

- Mattias Gustafsson - Franvarande
- Will Oldham - Western song for J.L.L.
- Ignatz - Drawn
