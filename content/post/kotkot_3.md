|3.|   |The sun is shining, the music is playing,|
|  |   |Why then does heart tremble so? ..|
|  |   |There, around the bend, looking good,|
|  |   |the regiment of hussars stands before the crowd.|
|  |   |<br>|
|  |   |The ladies blush and look forward to dancing,| 
|  |   |they decide, who will dance with whom.|
|  |   |<br>|
|  |   |But the main colonel on a bay mare|
|  |   |says: "Have all of you forgotten?|
|  |   |The dances were on Wednesday, now it is Sunday, on next Thursday - war. And there is no salvation.|
|  |   |<br>|
|  |   |And on the battlefield death walks everywhere.|
|  |   |Maybe we won't be back - I won't lie. "|
|  |   |<br>|
|  |   |The ladies don´t believe him and laugh unseen,|
|  |   |unaware that they really part. They say:|
|  |   |"Go fight, if you want, don't be late from your campaign "|
|  |   |<br>|
|  |   |The sun is shining, the music is playing,|
|  |   |Why then does heart tremble so? ..|

|  |   |Many times I saw them returning from school…|

|  |   |What about my dog?|
|  |   |Leave it, I'll give you another one.|
|  |   |A beautiful one?|
|  |   |A pretty one.|
|  |   |Where is it?|
|  |   |In my house.|

|7.|   |Hardworking beavers blocked the river here with a large dam and turned it into a huge pond, and built a solid hut-house near the shore, where they lived with their whole family.|
|  |   |Beavers swim and dive perfectly, and can stay under water for a long time.|

|9.|   |If you listen you can hear it call (Wailaree)|
|  |   |There is a river called 'the river of no return|
|  |   |sometimes it's peacefull and sometimes wild and free|
|  |   |Love is a traveller on the river of no return|
|  |   |swept on forever to be lost in the stormy sea (Wailaree)|
|  |   |I can hear the river call (no return, no return|

|11.|   |A normal tea, is it good, Alexey Fedorovich?|
|  |   ||
|  |   |What?|
|  |   |Do you like the tea, good tea?|
|  |   |I do not know, I do not even feel what kind of tea.|
|  |   |No, no, you do feel everything perfectly. A good strong tea, I just brewed myself.|
|  |   |<br>|
|  |   |Olya|
|  |   |Yes?|
|  |   |I can speak only for a few minutes, on which I reckon, because it’s hard for me to talk. But I wanted to talk to you.|
|  |   |I listen to you, Alexey Fedorovich.|
|  |   |I could not and did not have the opportunity to go into details, but I know that you have your own spiritual life, and not just physical chatter. That´s why you have always attracted me.|
|  |   |You have a feeling, a feeling of big life. Of course, we are all scattered, and we have to do a lot of empty, unnecessary things, otherwise it is difficult to live. And the majority ... (inaudible) But you| 
|  |   |are just different in what I said. You know how to suffer. Everyone suffers, and you especially know how to suffer.|
|12.|   | Our days are fleeing, disappearing in darkness.|
|  |   |Nothing will bring them back.|
|  |   |But it sounds again|
|  |   |Approaching to me|
|  |   |This day, this night, this garden.|
|  |   |Sounds come up from the deep,|
|  |   |The light thread of music is going on.|
|  |   |Forgotten days come alive again.|
|  |   |Spring takes us far, far away|
|  |   |When suddenly, in silence,|
|  |   |It will sound out of the window.|
|  |   |And we live again|
|  |   |in a magical land|
|  |   |And the light filled the distance.|
|  |   |And back again|
|  |   |Comes childhood to me|
|  |   |Forever, forever, forever.|
|  |   |Oh, how beautiful is the spring´s bloom!|
|  |   |The radiance of the day flows quietly|
|  |   |The world is again revealed to me.|
|  |   |Spring takes us far, far away|
|  |   |When suddenly, in silence,|
|  |   |It sounds out of the window.|
|13.|   |What am I doing here? What for am I dragging in strange outland?|
