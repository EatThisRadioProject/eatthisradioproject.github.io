Bastiaan was asked by the Ozon from Magnitogorsk (Russia) to do a mix for their exhibition called "Ambient". Two mixes where made and where used during the opening party and the fashion show. If all is good the mixes are still running during the whole exhibition. Just in case you are close to Magnitogorsk, the exhibition will be running from the 22nd of january 2019 until the 16th of march 2019. Enjoy!
